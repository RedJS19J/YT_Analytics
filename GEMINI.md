# Project Overview

This project is designed to analyze data from multiple YouTube channels. It utilizes the YouTube API to fetch channel and video information (normal videos, shorts, and live streams) over a configurable period. The results, including video counts and total views, are saved to a CSV file (`youtube_analytics.csv`) for historical tracking.

The project is highly configurable via a `.env` file and includes a utility script to easily generate the required channel configuration.

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  It is recommended to create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
3.  Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Configuration (`.env` file)

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project. This file controls the entire behavior of the scripts.

```
# Your YouTube API Key
YT_API_KEY='YOUR_API_KEY'

# The map of channels to analyze. Format is "DisplayName1:UC...id1,DisplayName2:UC...id2"
# This is generated by the utility script below.
YT_CHANNEL_MAP="JPmas:UC9eaNdd1t64xLogaRVmGrow,GoogleDevelopers:UC_x5XG1OV2P6uZZ5FSM9Ttw"

# The time window in days for the analysis.
YT_DAYS_TO_ANALYZE=1

# Temporary variable for the utility script: a simple list of channel names to find IDs for.
YT_CHANNELS_TO_CONVERT="jpmas,GoogleDevelopers"
```

## Project Workflow

The project works in two main steps: generating your channel map, and then running the analysis.

### Step 1: Generate Your Channel Map (One-time or when adding channels)

To avoid wasting API quota, the main script uses channel IDs. This utility script finds those IDs for you and formats them correctly.

1.  In your `.env` file, fill in the `YT_CHANNELS_TO_CONVERT` variable with a comma-separated list of the channel names or handles you want to analyze.
2.  Run the utility script:
    ```bash
    python generate_channel_map.py
    ```
3.  The script will output a single line of text (e.g., `jpmas:UC...id1,GoogleDevelopers:UC...id2`).
4.  Copy this entire line and paste it as the value for the `YT_CHANNEL_MAP` variable in your `.env` file.

### Step 2: Run the Analytics

Once your `YT_CHANNEL_MAP` is configured, you can run the main analysis script.

1.  (Optional) In your `.env` file, set `YT_DAYS_TO_ANALYZE` to the desired time window (e.g., `1` for daily analysis).
2.  Run the main script:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
3.  The script will print live progress to the console and, when finished, will create or append the results to the `youtube_analytics.csv` file.
